Abstract
============
    This project involves developing stabilizing controller for controlling the cyclic pitch dynamics of the helicopter. Initially the set of all stabilizing controllers are found and then one of them is selected to eliminate steady state error for a step response and give a finite value for ramp response. The frequency response of the sensitivity function of this controller is then plotted. Itâ€™s seen that the response goes to 1 as frequency goes to infinity. In the next part we design an optimal controller. Here we give equal weight to the input and output cost. Simulations for various input responses are given for both the
    controllers
